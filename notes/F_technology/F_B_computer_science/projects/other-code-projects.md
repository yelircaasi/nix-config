## RLCard
        * [RLCard: A Toolkit for Reinforcement Learning in Card Games – arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1910.04376/)
        * [Development — RLcard 0.0.1 documentation](https://rlcard.org/development.html#adding-new-environments)
    
## “philosophers and philosophies on the issues”
    
    → automated search and question answering
    
    → matrix completion?
    
    → product: database of answers to questions of the form “What does X say about Y?”
    
    → also interesting to do by hand / with a hybrid approach
    
## Book idea: Ancient Greek through the Stoics; Latin through the Stoics (or GR and LA in one book)
## Sheet Music Player: OCR for scanned sheet music, audio generation (MIDI as intermediate?)
## Other Projects 🌱

### Brainstorming

→ use evolutionary algorithm?

→ combine RL and evolutionary algorithm?

→ compare end-to-end with system that uses dynamic internal marking of cards (”need to win” / “need to get rid of”, etc.) and with system that uses probability of winning with each card

→ comparing systems that focus solely on making the bet with systems that also try to ruin the game for others (aggressive strategy)

→ different vector for each number of cards → output vector a score (softmax?) over cards in the hand, → action is to play the highest-scoring card
    → drawback: many different models; advantage: each model is fixed-size and relatively straightforward: $N = \sum^{15}_{i=1} i = 120$ → or N = 15?
    → parameters: 
        — $p_c(\textbf{c}) \in [0,1]^{k}$: probability of each card being out there — easy to calculate
        — $p_d(\textbf{c}) \in [0,1]^{k}$: probability of each card being played by someone else — calculate via MC


        — $w(\textbf{c}) \in [0,1]^{k}$: win probability of each card ← (remaining available to be made, wanted for each player, two probability vectors) — calculate via MC


        — $d(\textbf{c}) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}: ||d(c)||=1$: win desirability of each card ← (remaining available, wanted, two probability vectors, win probabilities) — calculate via MC? policy gradient?


        — $s(\textbf{c}) \in [0,1]$: overall hand strength ← (win probability, win desirability)


        — $u(\textbf{c}) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$: score (utility) per card ← (win probability, win desirability, expected change in overall hand strength)


        — $m \in \{0, 1\}^{k}$: use a card mask to only update values for cards in my hand


        — alternative: recursive formulation, beginning with last card of the round


        — another option: $f(\textbf{c}) \in \{0,1\}^{211}$: card score distribution ← (surplus tricks, size 2k+1, cards in my hand, probability of cards still being out there, position in queue, cards already played) → dimensionality 2k+1+60+60+4+60 = 2k+185 → add number still wanted by each opponent

### Games


#### wizard


* model for each round: jester, wizard, trump, color A, color B, color C → how to achieve interchangeability between non-trump colors? will it learn this automatically if colors are assigned randomly to letters?
* states:
    - betting state: number of players, round number, trick number, cards in hand
    - playing state: number of players, round number, trick number, tricks to make, cards already played → probability of cards , cards in hand
* actions: bet made, card played
* policies:
    - betting policy: betting state → bet
    - playing policy: playing state → card
* → how to learn? simultaneously? iteratively? (seems better)

* Combinatoric-probabilistic features:
* Probability that each player can beat each card
* Probability that each player wants to beat each card

    - Contrib Ideas
        
        update notion-sdk
        
        make taskw compatible with Python 3.11-12
        
        improve pytest documentation (more like the pytest book)
        
        type hints in loguru
        
        type hints in dynaconf
        
        make pre-commit PR -> find gap
        
        format pyenv output
        
        fix pyenv for use in scripts
        
        eventually: contribute to zathura-pdf-mupdf get running for Ubuntu 22.04
        
        - Nautilus fix
            
            need to make it possible to remove Music, Videos, Pictures from Nautilus sidebar
            
            → get involved with Gnome project and understand the codebase
            
    - model of optimal amount of information (informedness)
        - related: idea system of aggregation of knowledge and insights - “How can everybody’s (informed) view matter?” (“trickle-up?”)
        - related to optimal organizing forms ( → modeling, see Networks, Crowds, and Markets book)
        - → write and article of different models/views of news media consumption
        - 
    - Word Translation Graph
        - start with prepositions
        - use embeddings and compare embeddings to weighted combinations of translations’ embeddings?

add to rosetta-projects: Rust port of nand2tetris suite

IDEA: AI-driven tool to generate or check git commit messages on the basis of the diff. → how does copilot work? how does codex work? how do alternative tools work?

    move “other” from Recursos por idioma to Notion
    
    → make Configurability Github organization with forks of apps that support custom colors and keybindings (or just patches?)
    
    Wie kann ich mich mehr politisch engagieren?
    
    Just re-write plt code in typescript/JavaScript to use a good highlighting library pre-html; use Perl for something else, like shell scripts

    Look for software that can apply a complex (and continuous) color remapping to a PDF file, or patch my own!!!
    
    Re-write tree command to show view proportional to LoC or other metrics (tree + tokei, etc)
* https://www.mypy-lang.org/ → make PR: roadmap on site not found
    
    → use mypyc for planager? → compile with codon / mypyc / rewrite in cython and compile?
    
    Write Python script to parse poetry lockfile, query most recent version (pypi / [Github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76133390/how-to-use-github-api-to-retrieve-the-latest-version-of-a-package)) to identify which can be updated

    Fork terminal matrix video and use braille for an improved image → even unicode http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_ascii_art.html 
    
    → simple pixelwise regression → pixelwise regression weighted relative to edges? → 
    
    write library for terminal art like ascii art, but with unicode!
    
    → https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ascii-art-to-unicode.html 
    
    Cool for images, but also for text → box lines and block characters, as well as curves
    
    Braille text art would also be cool → “brailletters” → write CLI in Nim, Zig, Vlang or something?
* https://github.com/snyde875/ASCII-Art-Tool 
    
    Re-write Matrix terminal to use braille and alternatively to use (a suitable set of) unicode characters
    
    Which font processing libraries already exist? How to interface with them?
    
    - alignment
        
        let "word" = "lemma" in what follows
        
        given 2 sentences which may be a match:
        
        what
         is the probability of word ai and word bj co-occurring in a correct 
        match vs in an incorrect match? -> ratio, i.e. certainty gain
        
        add up log certainty gain for all relevant word pairs found in the sentence
        
        find most predictive words (i.e. word pairs)
        
        Also negative aspect? -> words highly likely to be translated with another word should decrease certainty if it is not found
