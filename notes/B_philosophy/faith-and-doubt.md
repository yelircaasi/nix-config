# Faith and Doubt in the LDS Experience

* Faith and Doubt in the LDS Experience
* 0) Note to the Reader
* 1) Background
* 1.1 Why I decided to write this book
* 1.2 Intended audienceThis book is intended for those in and around the CoJCoLDS community, broadly defined, especially those whose lives have been affected in some way by doubt, whether their own or that of a loved one. While I have attempted to take a thorough, systematic approach to the ideas and experiences related to doubt, I recognize that doubt can be as much an emotional experience as an intellectal one. My hope is that this book will be clear and accessible to people from a variety of spiritual and intellectual backgrounds.
* 1.3 Objectives and Guiding Questions
* My objective is to take a close look at the ideas and experiences underpinning faith and doubt. To me, these are interesting topics on their own, but their true importance comes from the effect they have on our lives. Religious beliefs, for those of us who believe, are a source of identity and purpose, and the prospect of losing them can be terrifying. I suspect that this is why so many struggle when others around us undergo transitions of faith.
* 1. Why do we disagree?
* 2. How much religious disagreement can we explain without demonization (i.e. without reference to the moral character of those who disagree)?
* 3. What is the best way to deal with differences of belief and practice when these can have devastating consequences for those on all sides? How can we minimize the harm, and who is responsible for which steps?
* 2) Ground Rules (Courtesy and Logic)
* 2.1 Non-contradiction
* 2.2 Deduction
* 2.3 Induction
* 2.4 Occam’s Razor
* Occam's Razor is different from the first three rules in that it is not universally agreed-upon in the religious context. It functionas more as a general guideline and less as a law that can be invoked in a rigorous proof. It holds that, given competing hypotheses, the simplest one should be privileged over more complex hypotheses unless the latter are better supported by the available evidence. Another variant of Occam's Razor is the following: "Extraordinary claims require etraordinary evidence." It is not hard to see why this does not tend to change minds: Believers and skeptics do not always agree on what constitutes "extraordinary evidence."
* 2.4 The Principle of Charity and "Ironmanning"
* It is a truism in many circles that "everyone has their bias" or "everyone has an agenda." To the extent that is true, and my experience has shown that it generally is, it is natural to paint one's opponents in a worse light than oneself. This is the tendency underlying the infamous "ad hominem" attacks that plague so much of the discourse among conflicting worldviews. It is anything but natural to examine evidence even-handedly and dispassionately; if an assertion confirms deeply-held convictions, it simply doesn't feel necessary to subject it to the same level of scrutiny as those that conflict with them. Confirmation bias is among the most firmly established results in the psychological literature. An extension of this behavior is the tendency to frame opposing arguments in their weakest form.

* 3.0 Raw skepticismFor many non-believers, the strongest argument is simply a lack of perceived evidence. To a skeptic, it is reasonable to believe an affirmative claim only when provided with compelling evidence.    Skeptics make an important distinction between rejecting a claim and affirming its opposite. The philosopher Bertrand Russell used the following claim as an example: “There is a teapot orbiting the sun.” In fairness, this could be true, and until we can gather definitive proof that there is no teapot, one can’t claim with certainty that there is no teapot; as one often hears, “you can’t prove a negative.”     With only the fact that there is no evidence of Russell’s teapot, and no further facts, it would be unjustified to claim that there is or isn’t a teapot. We are simply agnostic. But if we bring in other facts, we can show that one side is more or less likely, given the balance of information available. For example, given that teapots are only known to be made by humans, and that there is no known way in which a teapot could end up orbiting the sun, it becomes less likely. When we consider that

* Polygamy
* While polygamy and racism belong in the Social Issues category as well, I have decisded to included them here, in part because there are more prevalent current social issues, and in part because when members speak of struggles with "church history," it is very likely that they are struggling with one of these two.

* Evolution and Creation: There is no way around the mountains of evidence for evolution by means of natural selection as proposed by Darwin and refined by biologists since. The evidence is to be found primarily in the fields of genetics, paleontology and the fossil record, anatomy, molecular biology, biogeography, embryology, and taxonomy, as well as direct observation. A brief overview of the evidence is given in Appendix X. I have found it to be even more convincing upon closer examination. There are very few who seriously engage with the ideas and evidence underlying the theory of evolution and do not acknowledge its validity. All of them, with no known exceptions, are motivated by religious fundamentalism.

* 3.4.2: Feminism
* Gender issues and feminism was portrayed by some of the more conservative apostles of the 80's and 90's as one of the greatest threats to the church. Today, gender issues are one of the more challenging issues that active, believing members face. There is increasingly more friction between western, liberal cultures and what has traditionally between taught about patriarchy and the proper role of women.
* For many women and not a few men, the question "Why do men hold the priesthood while women do not" is a challenging one.
* 3.4.3: Homosexuality
* Homosexuality is, in some ways, an even greater challenge for younger members of the church. This is likely because, while feminism has existed in some form in western society for well over a century, the shift in public opinion toward homosexuals and questions regarding "same-sex marriage" has shifted dramatically in the past two decades. Moreover, increasing familiarity with homosexual individuals has been a key factor in this shift. As recently as 2000, <insert statistic on shiting culture around LGBTQ issues>.

* 6.2 Untenable Claims
* 6.3 Rough-Grained Filters: Apologetics that Apply too Broadly
* Apologetics aiming to defend the unique truthfulness of the LDS church faces a challenge in their definition of truth: If they define it too narrowly, the church can become vulnerable to its own historical deviations and imperfections. If they define it too loosely, other churches are liable to slip through the cracks.
* 6.4 Candidates for a Suitable Truth Filter - Or Are We Using the Wrong Criteria?
* 8) Trouble with Doctrine
* 7.1 Jello and Tar Babies: The Importance of Well-Defined Beliefs
* Ill-defined doctrine favors apologists over critics. This is due to the dichotomy often drawn between "the Church" and its leaders, or between "the Church" and its membership. One often hears a parallel dichotomy drawn between the doctrines of the church and its culture. This serves to reinforce a popular line of defence: "The Church is true, but the members aren't." Sometimes apologists go further: "The Church isn't perfect, but the Gospel is." This creates an additional hurdle for critics. It is not sufficient for them to cite embarrassing or reprehensible statements and policies made by church leaders in the past; first, they must show that the church is responsible for the ideas and practices rather than rogue individuals who were merely "speaking as men." Because there is no LDS catechism, and because the church believes in continuing revelation, this is notoriously difficult to show. In fact, it is easier to list the teachings of the church that have not changed than it is to list those that have. This is because apologists are primarily concerned with defending the faith to those already motivated to believe, and if they can cast any doubt on the lines of criticism or advance a convincing interpretation that carves out a space for faith, they have accomplished their goal. One of the key tools in their toolkit is that of deniability. Unless the audience for the debate consists of those who hold church leadership to the standard of perfection, it is not usually enough for a critic to cite embarrassing or reprehensible statements made by church leaders in the past. they must show that the statements were representative of church policy if they are to succeed at sowing doubt in the credibility of the church as a whole.

* 8.1 Defining Terms
* Pride and humility are two widely-shared values. Pride is universally, at least in the sense of arrogance, self-importance, and conceit. Humility is a desirable trait, something to be praised in an admiral individual who suffers from no delusions of his own grandeur. Humility can reasonably be generally defined as a reasonable and realistic sense of one's own weaknesses and shortcomings and is practically interchangeable with teachability. While the abstract sense of what the two words connote is hardly controversial, it is usually in concrete applications that the differences of usage and interpretation become apparent.
* 8.2 Pride and Humility in the Eyes of a Believer
* To a believer, humility is the essence of discipleship. To be humble means to follow Jesus Christ and "lean not unto thine own understanding." It entails trusting the church leaders and acknowledging the possibility (or rather, the likelihood) that they know more than one does, especially in spiritual matters. Humility is the antithesis of the pride of, for example, the "learned who think they are wise … and hearken not unto the counsels of God." The sneering condescension of those who have left the fold is a perfect example of what they hope to avoid.
* 8.3 Pride and Humility in the Eyes of a Skeptic
* To a skeptic, the most important form of humility is often what they might call epistemic humility - openness to the possibility of being mistaken (at least in theory; this trait seems to be  more common in the abstract than in the real world). Uncertainty is a key aspect of humility, to be contrasted with the certainty of believers and the grandiose claims they advance.

This is why the one-dimensional “left-right” political spectrum falls short, and although the “political compass” is an improvement, it also fails to capture all of the subtlety of political poisitions in the real world.
