* Wзучение о паганыm
* Wormon defense/rationale for patriarchalism
* Women against feminimism
* Why are there some ideas (like 1 immaterial God) that appeal to us? How does that work?

* составить список притч
* ежедневное заучение содержания 5и стихов
* планирования совместных изучений с Сандрой и молитв
* La fede è fondamento di diò che si spera e prova di ciò che non si vede. Che cosa io spero? Sono io approvati da Dio? Che cosa io non vedo? Fede è la chiave alla creazione.
* Howard Buffett, philanthropist
* What is the good fruit in Matthew 13? How am I choked sometimes by the "cares of this world?"
* The Doctrine of eternal marriage is the path to complete happiness in the eternities. I have never heard a doctrine, though, that those who have a happy marriage (especially those who live good Christian principles the best they know how to) will not be able to have some kind of relationship in the eternities, albeit inferior to and limited compared to eternal marriage.
* Why are those who create so much beauty and good often out of touch with what they create? It is difficult to fathom that some of the authors, composers, singers, artists, and so on, who have given the world some of its highest culture, have turned thir backs on the light that illuminated them. Conversely, it is odd that so many good, humble, righteous people are otherwise unremarkable.
* Make a list to categorize and chart the vrious concerns people have
* it is reassuring to know that God is perfectly just, and that everyone will be justly rewarded for his or her own choices. This fact alone answers dozens of otherwise confusing and troubling questions.
* What exactly is a concubine and why were concubines allowed in biblical times?
* What are the merits and shortcomings of jealousy, i.e. what purposes doe it serve and to what extent should it be avoided? How does it relate to plural marriage? What are the differences between monogamous and polygamous societies, and at what point is plural marriage entered into?
* What is the future of those who love but do not have an eternal marriage?
* What does it mean to be judged for one's works?
* What is the purpose of love and family life in this life for those who will ot be part of an eternal family? -present happiness, future relationship (albeit ot status), memories, personal growth and development
* Search all instances of the word "prosper" in the Book of Mormon
* What are the philosophical implications of the existence of a devil, as opposed to bad thoughts independent of demonic influence?
* Was bedeutet es, dass Amerika “vor allen anderen Ländern der Erde auserwählt”ist? Erzählerfreiheit, Nationalismus, kontextual, nur in manchen Sinnen/Hinsichten, nur Mexiko?
* Leonard Erington - Church historian
* Graph: faith and education (true education = understanding) (Y,X)
* The message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is not that those without the Gospel are without good or that they cannot find some happiness, but that Jesus Christ can add to it, greatly improve their lives, and lighten their burdens.
* Thanks to the Atonement, those without the Gospel can still find much joy and become significantly better, even if not completely.
* People choose evil:
* because they choose what they want now over what they want later (instant gratification)
* because they are choosing lower forms of gratification, such as pride
* because of a failure to investigate the morality of an action
* because they choose to be wilfully ignorant
* because misery loves company
* because of what feels easiest at first
* because of willful rebellion against God
* Glory seems to be synonymous with spiritual advancement and obtainment of righteousness. This seems consistent with the scriptural usage, and the other connotations would seem to be an outward manifestation of the first, deeper meaning.
* The Gospel isn’t about living only for this life or only for the next, but living righteously and happily in this life so as to obtain the best possible life in the next as well.
* there may be terrible sufferings and trials on earth, but living the Gospel provides peace and joy in the midst of it all, as well as a sure hope of eventual deliverance.
* Regardless of what individuals, families, and nations choose to become, they have the potential to become righteous, regardless of past or identity.
* What is the normative division of labor between men and women?
* Men - physical strength, breadwiner, fatherhood, presiding leader, priesthood blessings
* Momen - emotional sensitivity, motherhood, nurture, homemaking, charitable service
* Important truths: The priesthood does not debase women because they do not hold it; it serves and exalts them, through blessing, administration, ministration, association, and supporting and honoring their roles. They have their own roles and own gifts, rights, and legitimacy, but the priesthood is necessary for them as well, just as they are to the priesthood.
* The “noble spirits” seem to have been born everywhere, at times that are right for them, with the opportunities and challenges that are best suited for them. All things are not yet clear, but I should not try to judge people’s premortal righteousness. It is not very relevant, and I simply do not know.
* Reassuring truths:
* Everyone is rewarded according to the good they do and punished for the unrepented evil they do.
* Everyone will receive a chance to accept the Gospel.
* Memories are forever and good experiences and feelings can be relived.
* Why be excellent?
* individual mission to perform
* individual development and uniquesness
* portion of the path of eternal progression
* eternal and temporal influence on others
* for the glory of God
* better memories
* smoother, more enjoyable path
* virtue is its own reward
* What constitutes beauty, happiness, and so on? Everything is built on “axia” or “indivisibles” - feelings, colors, sounds, matter, other fundamental concepts. When combined in certain ways, they evoke corresponding feelings.
* These indivisibles are eternal and indestructible, and can be combined in an infinite number of ways. they are presumably co-eternal with God, if they are all analogous to matter, and the doctrine of eternal matter is true.
* They derive much of their beauty and meaning from their connection and relationship to each other.
* There is real power in outward, symbolic actions that are expressive of sincere desire to follow Christ, and that are performed by authority from God. That seems to be the reason for the extreme importance of ordinances.
* Love is a connection of the light, i.e. the good, in people.
* Everyone has his/her own “bounds of habitation”, or place and time in which to live, depending on what the Lord has determined in His perfect love and knowledge. It is our job to improve everybody’s situation inasmuch as we can. That is the purpose of missionary work, both here and in the spirit world. Sooner is better, but all will be reached.
* What I love about the Gospel of Jesus Christ:
* It allows me to repent, become free of guilt, and be cleansed and forgiven
* It helps me to become better and gives me meaningful goals to work on.
* It gives me an understanding of God, life, and myself.
* It strengthens my relationships with family and friends
* It has shown me what truly matters and what does not
* It helps me to change for the better
* It has given me opportunities to love, learn, serve, and develop friendships
* It has taught me the meaning and importance of cleanliness, and how to maintain it
* It provides answers to my questions if I am willing to look
* De misión:
* Agency is influenced by every factor, but not controlled by any, even past decisions.
* The Church is powerful and true, but it is up against: tradition, prejudice, preconceived false ideas, addiction, unwillingness to change, pride, misunderstanding, laziness, ambivalence, hate, stereotypes, busy schedules, shady spots in its own history, and unanswered questions.

“Choosing the Right” means following one’s spiritual feeling (confirmation of right, light of Christ) over lower feelings, like pleasure, logic (based on incomplete basic assumptions), or negative emotions; it is acting consistently with one’s knowledge (from spiritual sources) of right and wrong.
* Comparison, favorable or unfavorable, of oneself to others is a form of pride if accompanied by a sense of hostility and opposition. Pride can be avoided if we look forward and seek to learn from those who are further and help those who are less far along. That is humility.
* We are fellow travellers along the same path, diverse and unique, at different degrees of advancement but with the same destination, or at least potential.
* Just as language can influence the character, or style, of individuals, individuals give character to the language by their use of it. Every language has its own aesthetic, which becomes a part of the aesthetic of its speakers.
* Emphasis does not imply neglect; rather, it is an approach centered on a concept or idea and using it to incorporate the other elements.
* The good life: time with family, nature and outdoors activity, true friendship, dating, learning and studying, sports and games, serving others, worthwhile hard work, sincere worship, beauty (art, music, food, literature)
* What is implied in being completely selfless and devoted to others? You have to take good care of yourself, even to be able to effectively bless and serve others. Like Christ, it is important to integrate the two, developing oneself while blessing others, and so on.
* Division of knowledge: good and evil, relevant and irrelevant, spiritual and secular, subjective and objective, interesting and less interesting (implying individuality)
* Factors in determining the morality of an action: timing, purpose, results, intention
* What are the fundamental axia underlying all of realism: action, movement, good and bad feeling, form, attributes, senses, relationships, time, place, substance
* Time and agency seem to be extremely closely related. Both are fairly simple concepts to grasp, but difficult to truly understand. Agency is the right and ability to make choices for oneself to develop and to receive the consequences of one’s actions. Time is the framework in which choices are made and in which change (of state) occurs; time is change.
* Character forms and keeps friendships, which, in turn, develop character. It is a symbiotic relationship. Character is the sum total of the attributes that are part of a person and that describe his or her behavior.
* Factors that influence the acquirement of knowledge and understanding: opportunity, desire, interest, effectiveness of study, variety of subects of study, natural and acquired learning ability
* Religious sacrifice is a good indicator of how risk-averse people are with respect to the afterlife. Faith and perceived risk of sacrifice have some kind of inverse relationship, which would make it possible to investigate how much different groups of people weight the possibility of eternal reward in their current consumption decisions.
* God gave men commandments after haviing made known the Plan of Salvation. This gave them meaning and context, empowering the people to act with understanding and vision.

* Are there any influential anti-pornography groups in Europe to supplement conservative churches?
* One of my most pressing questions: What is the process by which people are deceived? How does it take place, and why are so many people deceived and convinced that they are right? Why do people make stupid and irrational decisions?
* Why do we sin? A lack of information may play a part, and a disposition toward evil may as well, but how is it that we are held accountable for our inherent weaknesses or for our environments? Is there a kind of “necessary sin” that is part of our growth processes and that rendered the Atonement necessary? I can see that there is still a substantial amount that I do not yet understand”

* Talk beginning: Most talks in Church entail a certain degree of hypocrisy, and this one is no exception. I don't even perfectly understand everything I'll say to you today, and I fall short in applying it to my own life. I speak not as a flawless example of the principles I teach, but as a sinner who understands his dependance on Jesus Christ and struggles to apply His teachings to his life. I love Him, and His Gospel means everything to me.
* Our main purpose in coming together today is to remember and worship our Savior and to renew our covenants with Him by partaking the sacrament. Everything I say is circumscribed by the purpose of this meeting. ...

* How many people from “apostate” societies accept the Gospel and go to the celestial Kingdom?
* This is Isaac, and I'm not concerned with anonymity, bit it's sometimes easier to express long thoughts in writing. I have several questions about the Gospel and the things that go with it. It may make sense to split them up over classes or not answer all of them.
* What are some things we can do to help distinguish between Church culture and the Gospel? Hypothetically, how could the Church be different with the same essence of the Gospel?
* I am quite familiar with Church history, including the parts that don't make sense or might make some people uncomfortable, as well as the wonderful and inspiring. Sometimes I get the sense that in the Church, we excuse things Church leaders have done while condemning them in other people. Why do we do that? I understand that we should be very careful in interpreting different times and cultures, but wouldn't it be better to be coto wouldn't it be better to be fair and consistent? I have found that to healthiest for my own faith, but I like to hear other opinions?

* Are there machines in heaven? If so, what kinds are there? Is intelligent or machinated labor more efficient? Is most of the technology that has been developed by humans solely a human phenomenon? What do earthly and heavenly technology have in common?
* Given that the earth will one day, according to Joseph Smith, be renewed and become a sphere of glass or a “giant Urim and Thummim”, will there still be color? How will it be different than the world is today?
* Many believe that the transformation from matter to energy is irreversible, or that there is no way to transform energy to matter. How can the works of God be eternal if there is a finite amount of matter, and therefore energy, in the universe? Is there an infinite amount of matter in the universe? Is there a process by which energy is returned to matter?

* In the grand, eternal scheme of things, what is the significance of fashions, trends, and cultures?
* Ecclesiastes 1:18 says that “in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth in knowledge increaseth sorrow.” Is that a mortal phenomenon only? What causes it?

Was Solomon feeling particularly melancholy or cynical when he wrote Ecclesiastes?
* What is the relationship between omniscience and creativity? Is it possible to be creative with a knowledge of everything past, present, and future?
* I have sometimes thought of Plato’s Theory of the Forms, with different words, of course, before I heard of it, and it has a certain “ring of truth” to it. Which parts are true, and how does it synthesize with what I already know to be true?
* Given that someday we will learn everything, what is the meaning and significance of humanity’s intellectual progress and endeavors here and now? Is it overrated by intellectuals?

* Is the question “What if there were no God?” at all relevant to reality or to life?
* Is there an absolute set of desirable attributes? If there is, what determines them? Are they rooted in long-run and universal (i.e. eternal) pragmatism? Are they self-existent and coeternal with God? Are they both? How much variation and flexibility is there in the character and personality of perfected (eternal) beings?
* Is it ironic that, of all creatures, the most glorious and intelligent is also the least self-sufficient?
* Why does a just God interfere with some, like Paul and Alma the younger, but leave others to sin?
* When one becomes perfect, what other than looks sets him or her apart from other perfected beings? How much individuality does a perfected being have?
* Is one’s level of intelligence achieved in this life a factor in the exaltation? If one has a higher level of intelligence than another who is equally righteous, will he be rewarded (or exalted) above the other, or simply further along in his eternal progression? Will we have different estates and roles determined by our individual intelligence? oes Ether 12:27 apply in the next life as well as in this (for those who are faithful but of lesser intelligence)?
* Was the idea of “manifest Destiny” actually the will of God?
