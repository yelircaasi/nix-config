### Learning

* “Students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write reflectively about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.”
* A few tips while learning online is to always take simple notes, writing takeaways at the end of the day or blogging about what you’ve learned. By the same vein, utilizing the Feynman Technique by explaining what you have learned to friends and family is important, especially for a complex subject such as Data Science.  ||  Moreover, when learning machine learning algorithms and neural networks, it’s crucial to learn it along with writing the code, this way you can see what you’re learning, and have a better understanding of the topic at hand. It’s also good to be a part of online communities such as Reddit, Discord, etc. so you can ask questions and obtain great answers from experts.

### Thought Snippets, Quotes, Aphorisms

O perfeito homem do mundo seria aquele que jamais hesitasse por indecisão e nunca agisse por precipitação.

A liberdade é a possibilidade do isolamento. Se te é impossível viver só, nasceste escravo.

Todo o homem é culpado do bem que não fez.
* [news.uwa.edu.au/201309176069/alumni/tim-minchin-stars-uwa-graduation-ceremony](http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201309176069/alumni/tim-minchin-stars-uwa-graduation-ceremony)
     Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Tim Minchin
     In darker days I did a corporate gig at a conference for this big company who made and sold accounting software in a bid, I presumed, to inspire their salespeople to greater heights. They’d forked out 12 grand for an inspirational speaker who was this extreme sports guy who had had a couple of his limbs frozen off when he got stuck on a ledge on some mountain. It was weird.
     Software salespeople I think need to hear from someone who has had a long successful career in software sales not from an overly optimistic ex-mountaineer.
     Some poor guy who had arrived in the morning hoping to learn about sales techniques ended up going home worried about the blood flow to his extremities. It’s not inspirational, it’s confusing. And if the mountain was meant to be a symbol of life’s challenges and the loss of limbs a metaphor for sacrifice, the software guy’s not going to get it, is he? Because he didn’t do an Arts degree, did he? He should have.
     Arts degrees are awesome and they help you find meaning where there is none. And let me assure you… there is none. Don’t go looking for it. Searching for meaning is like searching for a rhymes scheme in a cookbook. You won’t find it and it will bugger up your soufflé. If you didn’t like that metaphor you won’t like the rest of it.
     Point being I’m not an inspirational speaker. I’ve never ever lost a limb on a mountainside metaphorically or otherwise and I’m certainly not going to give career advice because, well I’ve never really had what most would consider a job. However I have had large groups of people listening to what I say for quite a few years now and it’s given me an inflated sense of self importance.
     So I will now, at the ripe old age of 37-point-nine, bestow upon you nine life lessons to echo of course the nine lessons of carols of the traditional Christmas service, which is also pretty obscure.
     You might find some of this stuff inspiring. You will definitely find some of it boring and you will definitely forget all of it within a week. And be warned there will be lots of hokey similes and obscure aphorisms which start well but end up making no sense. So listen up or you’ll get lost like a blind man clapping in a pharmacy trying to echo-locate the contact lens fluid.
     (crowd laughs) …Looking for my old poetry teacher.
     Here we go, ready?
     One: You don’t have to have a dream. Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams. Fine if you have something you’ve always wanted to do, dreamed of, like in your heart, go for it. After all it’s something to do with your time, chasing a dream. And if it’s a big enough one it’ll take you most of your life to achieve so by the time you get to it and are staring into the abyss of the meaningless of your achievement you’ll be almost dead so it won’t matter.
     I never really had one of these dreams and so I advocate passionate, dedication to the pursuit of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on whatever is in front of you. You never know where you might end up. Just be aware the next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery, which is why you should be careful of long-term dreams. If you focus too far in front of you you won’t see the shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right? Good! Advice metaphor… look at me go.
     Two: Don’t seek happiness. Happiness is like an orgasm. If you think about it too much it goes away. (crowd laughs) Keep busy and aim to make someone else happy and you might find you get some as a side effect. We didn’t evolve to be constantly content. Contented Homo erectus got eaten before passing on their genes.
     Three: Remember it’s all luck. You are lucky to be here. You are incalculably lucky to be born and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family who encouraged you to go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family that’s unlucky and you have my sympathy but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen to be made of the sort of DNA that went on to make the sort of brain which when placed in a horrible child environment would make decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were lucky. You didn’t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They’re not even your shoelaces.
     I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever dubious achievements I’ve achieved but I didn’t make the bit of me that works hard any more than I made the bit of me that ate too many burgers instead of attending lectures when I was here at UWA. Understanding that you can’t truly take credit for your successes nor truly blame others for their failures will humble you and make you more compassionate. Empathy is intuitive. It is also something you can work on intellectually.
     Four: Exercise. I’m sorry you pasty, pale, smoking philosophy grads arching your eyebrows into a Cartesian curve as you watch the human movement mob winding their way through the miniature traffic cones of their existence. You are wrong and they are right. Well you’re half right. You think therefore you are but also you jog therefore you sleep therefore you’re not overwhelmed by existential angst. You can’t be can’t and you don’t want to be. Play a sport. Do yoga, pump iron, and run, whatever but take care of your body, you’re going to need it. Most of you mob are going to live to nearly 100 and even the poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth that most humans throughout history could not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious life ahead of you is going to make you depressed. (audience laughs) But don’t despair. There is correlation between depression and exercise. Do it! Run, my beautiful intellectuals run.
     Five: Be hard on your opinions. A famous bon mot asserts opinions are like assholes in that everyone has one. There is great wisdom in this but I would add that opinions differ significantly from assholes in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined. (audience laughs) I used to do exams in here (audience laughs)… It’s revenge.
     We must think critically and not just about the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs. Take them out onto the verandah and hit them with a cricket bat. Be intellectually rigorous. Identify your biases, your prejudices, your privileges. Most of society is kept alive by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend to generate false dichotomies and then try to argue one point using two entirely different sets of assumptions. Like two tennis players trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate tennis courts.
     By the way, while I have science and arts graduates in front of me please don’t make the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are at odds with one another. That is a recent, stupid and damaging idea. You don’t have to be unscientific to make beautiful art, to write beautiful things. If you need proof - Twain, Douglas Adams, Vonnegut, McEwan, Sagan and Shakespeare, Dickens for a start. You don’t need to be superstitious to be a poet. You don’t need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You don’t have to claim a soul to promote compassion. Science is not a body of knowledge nor a belief system it’s just a term which describes human kinds’ incremental acquisition of understanding through observation. Science is awesome! The arts and sciences need to work together to improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians including our new PM and my distant cousin Nick Minchin believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming is controversial is a powerful indicator of the extent of our failure to communicate. The fact that 30 percent of the people just bristled is further evidence still. (audience laughs) The fact that that bristling is more to do with politics than science is even more despairing.
     Six: Be a teacher! Please! Please! Please be a teacher. Teachers are the most admirable and important people in the world. You don’t have to do it forever but if you’re in doubt about what to do be an amazing teacher. Just for your 20s be a teacher. Be a primary school teacher. Especially if you’re a bloke. We need male primary school teachers. Even if you’re not a teacher, be a teacher. Share your ideas. Don’t take for granted your education. Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.
     Seven: Define yourself by what you love. I found myself doing this thing a bit recently where if someone asks me what sort of music I like I say, “Well I don’t listen to the radio because pop song lyrics annoy me,” or if someone asks me what food I like I say, “I think truffle oil is overused and slightly obnoxious.” And I see it all the time online - people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists or the Liberal Party.
     We have a tendency to define ourselves in opposition to stuff. As a comedian I make my living out of it. But try to also express your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank you cards and give standing ovations. Be pro stuff not just anti stuff.
     Eight: Respect people with less power than you. I have in the past made important decisions about people I work with – agents and producers - big decisions based largely on how they treat the wait staff in the restaurants we’re having the meeting in. I don’t care if you’re the most powerful cat in the room, I will judge you on how you treat the least powerful. So there!
     Nine: Finally, don’t rush. You don’t need to know what you’re going to do with the rest of your life. I’m not saying sit around smoking cones all day but also don’t panic! Most people I know who were sure of their career path at 20 are having mid-life crises now.
     I said at the beginning of this ramble, which is already three-and-a-half minutes long, life is meaningless. It was not a flippant assertion. I think it’s absurd the idea of seeking meaning in the set of circumstances that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans to think the universe has a purpose for them. However I’m no nihilist. I’m not even a cynic. I am actually rather romantic and here’s my idea of romance: you will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and God it’s tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad and then you’ll be old and then you’ll be dead. There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence and that is fill it. Not fillet. Fill it. And in my opinion, until I change it, life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can. Taking pride in whatever you’re doing. Having compassion, sharing ideas, running, being enthusiastic and then there’s love and travel and wine and sex and art and kids and giving and mountain climbing, but you know all that stuff already. It’s an incredibly exciting thing this one meaningless life of yours. Good luck and thank you for indulging me.

### Notes To Sort

* Sort: Notes
* "I am so glad that I spent most of my 31st year developing an optimal system for my life, getting in shape, and intensively working on my skillset for work."
* 'sacred time' every morning and evening, midday when possible
* commit code to at least one project daily
* create  space to attain flow daily: uninterrupted offline time, both at work and in personal projects (pomodoro with longer increments?)
* improve note-taking system such that finding and taking notes is streamlined and nearly instantaneous
* phone use with a purpose, no distraction, procrastination, dopamine hits, etc
* flexible, robust, resilient master plan showing what steps I need to take to achieve my goals - adjustment possible when "life happens", showing which adjustments need to be made to plans and schedules
* daily cleanup: apartment, office, digital notes/emails/etc
* meaningful and well-reflected journal entry
* food system that involves long-term planning at different times resolutions: quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily -> maximize efficiency, frontload decision making. Emphasize tasty and inexpensive meals and frontload time-intensive ingredients shared between different meals (e.g. lentils,*  garbanzos)
* plan time to be bored and do nothing, time walking without phone, etc
* frontload decision making in general
* [Miyamoto Musashi | A Life of Ultimate Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUXEqS6GqUU)
* Identify cases when you procrastinate and the real reasons. Is the task too complicated? Are you bored or tired? Try to deal with the reason.
* Prioritize your to-do list * and try to stick to it, reminding yourself why it is important to you.
* Set time slots for work and rest. * For example, you can use the Pomodoro Technique.
* Make Meetup group(s)! [meetup.com/lp/how-to-group-start](https://www.meetup.com/lp/how-to-group-start)
* Dream: Make a beautiful microhouse, especially if I stay single.
* [Building a Life Dashboard — I'm starting a big life project for myself, which is tracking my overall life metrics around everything that matters to me. This will be a book someday. Basically, a life dashboard](https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=771bda851e&e=1a0e8f9a2d). The types of metrics I want to include are pretty exhaustive, and they go from the trivial to the ultimate meaning of being on the planet. Examples include: books read, friends called, side income generated, times I've given thanks, random kind acts performed, website traffic, calories consumed, number of workouts, BMI, resting heart rate, masters degree yes/no, nest-egg target hit (yes/no), etc. It'll be hundreds of metrics. And here's the cool part. I'm going to automate the shit of this. And build my own dashboard using Dashing.io or Tableau, and have it available as a mobile interface on my phone as well as displaying it prominently on the wall at home. The process starts with defining my life goals, which are informed by my entire life and everything I've ever read and experienced. And they will be regularly revisited as well. And then the metrics flow from there (I'm currently in the dashboard design phase), and I'll keep them right in my face constantly. The idea being, iif you know what you want, you should capture that and work actively towards it. And that's precisely what I'm going to do. I'll have some mock-ups to show soon.
* [Continuous Improvement — You may notice that these two efforts above have something in common. The unifying theme is something I wrote about in my book](https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=fbb75015f5&e=1a0e8f9a2d), which I called DOM, or Desired Outcome Management. The idea is to know what you want, to set up continuous monitoring of that thing, and then to use new knowledge and the results of monitoring to make/recommend changes to our behavior. Rinse and Repeat. GOALS --> MONITORING --> UPDATE GOALS --> UPDATE BEHAVIOR --> MONITORING --> REPEAT. This works for improving your retirement nest egg, your health, or your web testing methodology. And the mechanism I use to power all of this is QUESTIONS. What are you trying to accomplish in your life? How would you know you were successful? How would you know you're healthy? What do you need to know about a site to determine it's insecure? What about a website—if it were true—would prompt you to make an immediate change? Those are not just the questions I care about, but the questions that I intend to CONTINUOUSLY ask, in perpetuity. And if they ever become stale, I will replace them with better questions. That's part of the process. This is continuous monitoring and continuous optimization turned into an actual methodology. So that's what I'm on about.

* No tienes que temerle a la muerte si vives una existencia vacía y sin sentido en un universo lleno de sufrimiento donde absolutamente todo es efímero e intrascendente y donde de todos modos sabes que te vas a morir tarde o temprano pero no sin antes haber experimentado una imensa agonía a lo largo de una vida que fuiste obligado a vivir.
* tsundoku
* Ничтожество свое сознавай знаешь где? Перед Богом, пожалуй, перед умом, красотой, природой, но не перед людьми. Среди людей нужно сознавать свое достоинство.
* Wichtig: klare und insprieirende Ziele haben und mich ständig an sie erinnern
* Регулярно уделять время на то, чтобы учиться новому
* Все, что вы видите во мне - это ен мое, это ваше. Мое - это то, что я вижу в вас.
* São poucos que vivem o presente; maioria aguarda para viver mais tarde. - Swift
* O que eu ouço, eu esqueço. O que eu vejo, eu lembro. O que eu faço, eu entendo. -Confúcio
* Everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you. - Lamott
* Conte-me e eu esqeço. Mostre-me e eu apenas lembro. Envolva-me eu compreendo. - Confúcio
* When I say, "Hve you considered seeing a therapist?" I'm not saying "You're so messed up that only a professional can help you." What I'm saying is: "Have you considered that you're worthy of an unbiased, safe, and productive opportunity to process your experiences?"
* Apressa-te a viver bem e pensa que cada dia é, por si só, uma vida. - Seneca

Intrinsic thinking vs positional thinking: example: learning for learning’s sake; doing things for their own enjoyment, rather than merely to be better than others. “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.” Also relates closely to Stoicism. Important for coexisting with more intelligent beings/entities.

Two questions to ask yourself after every reading session: What do I want to remember forever? What can I do now in 5 minutes to apply what I learned?
* Receiving and soliciting feedback:
* know your tendencies
* disentangle the "what" form the "who"
* sort toward coaching over evaluation
* unpack (analyze) the feedback
* ask for just one thing (be specific)
* engage in small experiments to test feedback
* Elements of a model of self-control:
* intensity of desire to achieve goal
* clarity of vision
* ability to self-detach
* reponses to stimuli (neurological rewards)
* ability to modify one's own desires
* mental and emotional struggles (extenuating factors) and condition
* perceived badness of faiilure
* strength of relevant memories (of past succdess / failure) / forgetfulness
* discounting factor
* prior short-term exertion (depletion)
* efficacy - belief (in the moment) that efforts will bear fruit
* rationalizations of deviation, excuses
* tolerance for cognitive dissonance (between desired and current states)
* internalization of moral obligation ("I really should" vs. "my self-image depends on this")
* → degree of free will?
* enlightened admission of ignorance: realize how little I know about strangers and how much they could teach me, how much good they have achieved and how much they may yet be capable of
* universal need for attention
* power of remebrance and danger of forgetfulness
* positive and negative feedback cycles
* short-term pain + long-term satisfaction vs. short-term gratification + long-term regret: people can choose the kind of gratification they desire and thus move toward the good or away from it → it is possible to change one's desires through the active and incremental exercise of free will
* "And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good."
* hiraeth - (n.) a homesickness for a home to which you cannot return, a home which maybe never was; the nostalgia, the yearning, the grief for the lost places of your past
* Goethe-Zitat über Hemdknöpfe
* Vision, die stärker ist, als alles Andere (Gelüste und Drang)
* Perfektionismus als Feind des Guten → "Und jetzt, wo du nicht perfekt sein musst, kannst du gut sein."
* 3 Aufgaben: wissen, wollen, tun
* BYU questions: Habe ich völlige Umkehr von meinenSünden durchgemacht? Was ist mir los? Warum können andere partyen, sich schlecht ernähren? Warum sind Leistungen hier so wichtig? Wie viel werden sie im Nachher ausmachen? Wodurch? Gedächtnis, Erfahrung, Verhältnis zu verschiedenen Sachen und Ideen, oder wie?
* Welche Grundannahmen schädigen mich zurzeit?
* Warum ist mir das Verständnis so wichtig?
* Welche Einschränkungen habe ich geistig (oder sonst) auf mich angelegt?
* Darf ich überhaupt nicht an die Vergangenheit denken? Wie wäre das?
* Wie viele Drogenarten gibt es in der Tat (Gedanken, Besessenheit, Ablenkungen, Beschäftigungen usw.)
* Warum bin ich so schockiert und gestört worden, als Sandra mir von der Vergangenheit erzählt hat?
* Каждый день становится своим будущим.
* Нельзя в точности описать будущие шаги. Есть столько, что лежит вне моей контроли; есть мали вещей, которые зависят полностью лт меня.
* Вера изменяет восприятие реальности.
* Разницы во мнении нормальны. Надо глубоко понять, что есть многие факторы, влияющие на мое восприятие.
* Wie vermischt sich Stolz mit unsicherheit?
* Warum macht man beim Rauschtrinken, Rauchen usw. mit, wenn man schon weiß, was das dem Organismus antut? Sieht man nichts falsches daran? Was halten andere Religionen davon? Was traibt einen dazu?
* Warum verwendet man Schimpfwörte? Sehen die meisten nichts falsches daran?
* Wie kommt es dazu, dass man den eigenen Körper geringschätzt?
* Wenn man als Partyer aufwächst, wie wird man oft als Erwachsener?
* Wie ist die richtige Beziehung zur Vergangenheit?
* Wie ist es möglich, nicht getäuscht zu werden und der Versuchung nicht nachzugeben? Wie ist es möglich, Sünden zu verabscheuen und als widerlich zu empfinden, aber Menschen, die Sünde begehen, zu verstehen? Wenn man sich dazu zwingt, positiv und optimistisch zu denken, wie lange bleibt dies gefälscht, und wird das mit der Zeit zur Gewohnheit?
* 3 règles de base: Ne réponds jamais quand tu es énervé. Ne promets jamais quand tu es heureux. Ne prends aucune décision quand tu es triste.
* Idk who needs to hear this, but you're not overwhelmed. You are lazy and unorganized. Wake up earlier. Get an agenda book. Create a routine. Create boundaries (say no). Stick to your schedule. Write down AND adhere to your deadlines. You are standing in your own way.
* O homem nasceu para viver e não para se preparar para viver
* CompLing2019!
* Чего ты по-настоящему хочешь?
* Насколько надежна моя память?
* Обманывает мое восприятие времени?
* Элементы идеального образа жизни:
  * ясные цели
  * ясный, простой план
  * постоянное желание достичь цели
  * доведение отвлечений до минимума
  * убеждение во важности правильных поступков; чувство святого
  * > здоровый перфекционизм: легкий, умеренный страх перед слабостью и перед недостижением целей
  * > упрощение жизни и средоточий: 1 вещь одновременно
  * > ощущение, что я именно сейчас нахожусь в важном моменте: "теперь или никогда" -> противоядие от откладывания
  * самосознание как особенный: требование многого от себя
  * системная ответственность: регулярный отчет в использовании времени
  * великие стимулы: автономность, овладение, смысл; также увлечение, любовь, страсть, страх
  * определенный ригидность в представлениях о том, как мне быть; гибкость в том, что мне делать
  * жедание проявить себя
  * ясные ценности
  * вдохновение от необычайных людей
  * делать, просто делать, верить в себя и поправлять ошибки и недостатки без чрезмерных негативных чувств

  * Amy Chua - What Drives Success?

# Three elements that lead to success

The first is a superiority complex. A superiority complex means that a person has a “deep-seated sense of exceptionality.” This breeds confidence and nerve. The second element is a sense of insecurity or an inferiority complex. People must feel like they aren’t quite good enough, and that they have something to prove. This is opposing the superiority complex, and that’s the way it should be, Chua says. The third element of the triple package is impulse control; a person must have self-discipline. When explaining impulse control, Chua mentions the Finnish word “sisu”; a compound of bravado and bravery, ferocity and tenacity, of the ability to keep fighting after most people would have quit, and to fight with the will to win.

  * [This Is How To Have An Amazing Relationship: 7 Secrets From Research](https://bakadesuyo.com/2017/06/amazing-relationship/)
* Accept your partner “as is”: You can return it to the store but trying to repair it yourself voids the warranty.
* Express appreciation frequently: You’re with them for a reason. Tell them the reason. Often.
* Communicate from integrity: Admit when you’re wrong. And don’t punish them for telling the truth, even if you don’t like the truth.
* Share and explore differences with your partner: Don’t dodge the tough stuff. It’s okay to agree to disagree.
* Support your partner’s goals: If it matters to them, it’d be a really good thing if it mattered to you too.
* Give your partner the right to be wrong: You’re not perfect. So don’t insist that they be.
* Reconsider your wants as goals: They don’t “have to” do anything. But if you stop insisting, they might start agreeing.

  * 5 basic needs of every person:

1) I am of worth

2) My thoughts, feelings, and ideas matters, and have been considered

3) Someone really cares about me

4) What I am doing is aking a difference in the world

5) My agency is being honored

    "Man's supreme achivement in the world is communication from personality to personality." - Karl Jaspers

    Always respect the agency, opinions, thoughts, and choice of both.

  * Relationship Strategies

(This list is recorded as developed through experience, advice received, and collaboration with fellow missionaries; some female input was received. However, the thoughts and phrasings are essentially my own.)

Friendship first: stable basis for a relationship

Honesty: not showing or expressing more affection than you feel (less physically)

Social discipline: exercising restraint to avoid saying or doing embarrassing things

Observation: “looking before you leap”, examining character by watching

Realness: maximizing real, face-to-face communication, minimizing electronic communication

Pace: slowing down the process of emotional attachment to avoid premature decisions

Restraint: not holding hands until the second date, no kissing until the second date or later

Utility maximization: playing to your strengths

Humility: avoiding the social repellent of pride to minimize negative feelings

Competitiveness: being the right one for the right one  by having the right skills and qualities

Directness: straightforwardly and eloquently expressing one’s feelings at opportune moments

Romance: careful planning, honest and tactful compliments, thoughtful surprises (timing, atmosphere, courage, sincerity)

Win-win mentality: being happy for the successes and happiness of others

Mystery: keeping people guessing until the time is right (i.e. when it is no longer advantageous to have unknown intentions)

  * Marriage Notes

What a good marriage would look like:

* shared goals: be good parents for Leni, be happy together, have good careers
* good financial management and good household
* shared household responsibilities; process and system that we both buy into and that leave each feeling like an equal partner
* mutual support with good habits: healthy eating, workouts, good sleep schedules, moderate consumption (food, Netflix, YouTube, games), reasonable frugality
* shared interests and hobbies: Leni, board games, discovering new movies, book to read together
* friends - important to have other social contacts, which helps us to see each other with new eyes and helps us avoid getting in a rut
* trust - transparent communication, honesty, no cheating, no spying, no paranoia
* weekly date (typically high-quality, high-effort)
* dating mentality - find ways to keep the relationship fresh and beat complacency
* both elements of a healthy marriage present: companionate love (quality friendship) and erotic love (attraction, intimacy, good sex life)

Concerns:

* trust - how can Sandra trust me again? How can she avoid feeling paranoid about what I think and feel
* potential for resentment - anytime there are two good options, there is the potential for bitterness and regret over what was given up
* old habits - compulsive/addictive behaviors, self-isolation and increased distance between partners, condescension, dismissiveness, insults and hurtful communication
* psychological adjustment - how can Isaac fill the gap that has been variously filled by online projects, Wizard, language exchange, online flirting, and Polina? Can Sandra really fill the gap left by hours of Netflix and/or online gaming?
* triggers - each of us has things that provoke us in ways that might seem extreme or irrational. For Isaac, these include perceived disinterest or condescension and the perception of a “I don’t want you but I don’t want anyone else to have you” mentality. For Sandra, this includes anything that feels verbally abusive, such as attacks on her character or appearance, and also anything that triggers her fear of being cheated on
* complacency - “We’re already married and he/she is contractually obligated to like me the way I am, so I don’t need to make an effort anymore”
* communication - so many high-stakes discussions end in unproductive and bitter fights - two oldest children with big egos in the same relationship
* boredom/frustration - how can we keep marriage from feeling stale and intellectually, sexually, and socially unfulfilling (even imprisoning)?
* imbalance in responsibilities - Sandra doing everything with bureaucracy, taxes, etc., leaving her feeling overworked and like the only adult in the relationship, and Isaac feeling out-of-the-loop, incompetent, and infantilized
* hurt and resentment - is it even possible to get rid of the baggage we carry, or is it too far gone and too toxic, and we both need a fresh start with someone else?
* Leni - she is a major factor in this, and one that, in all honesty, has made it more difficult to pull the plug completely when we might otherwise have done so. A toxic relationship would be worse for her than a divorce, and a divorce later on would be more traumatic for her than a divorce now

  * Productivity 31

2. Take a second to pause before you respond. Become less reactive.

3. Read something every day. Even just one page.

4. Write something every day. Even just one paragraph.

5. Automate and batch as much as you can. Our brains have more room to be creative when they're not constantly making decisions.

6. Get some sun on your skin as early as you can in the day.

7. When your brain hurts. Stop working. Take a quick break to disconnect and recharge.

8. Limit your to-do list to the top 3 most important tasks of the day.

14. Track everything you do for one day to the minute. Find your time-sinks.

15. Stop comparing you behind the scenes to every one else’s highlight reel.

16. Be bored more often. Give your brain space to be creative.

17. Listen more than you speak.

18. Create more than you consume

19. Compliment more than you complain.

20. Delete apps you don’t use.

21. Donate clothes you don’t wear.

25. Take care of your information diet — Junk info hurts our brains like junk food hurts our bodies.

26. Look at your phone less, look at people’s eyes more.

27. Revisit things that have brought you joy in the past. They will probably do it again.

28. Set time limits on tasks. Use “Parkinson’s Law” in your favor.

29. Remember people’s names and use them often.

30. Drink more water.

  * Meaningful Compliments and Advice

Compliments

Elder Henrik Osthed: “I honestly feel so lucky to have served with you. You taught me so many things. … You made me feel important and needed. You helped me understand just how much I can be with the Lord’s help. You are a wonderful man, a wonderful missionary, and a classy southern-German-Guamish-English gent. Though I use humor, I hope you understand that I mean all of this. You have changed my life for the better.

Thank you for the laughs, thank you for taking time and listening even when you might not have wanted to, thank you for being a strong, quiet example, thank you for helping me see my worth, thank you for picking me up when I fall down, thank you for helping me be healthier, thank you for always being honest, thank you for supporting my weaknesses, but most of all, thank you for being my friend. It means the world to me. I am so glad the Lord put you in my life.

You were just what I needed. Best companion I ever did have. I would follow you anywhere my friend.”

Sister Renee Andrade: “Let me take the opportunity to tell you a few great things about yourself:

1. You’ve got a great British accent. Can you keep it permanently? No. Can you use it on special occasions? Most definitely.
2. You are a great teacher. You really listen.
3. You are probably the most, the very most dedicated, diligent person in the entire world. It’s inspiring, really. I want to be you!
4. You play a mean game of fooseball (don’t know if that’s spelled right). Rematch! For sure.
5. You think you are a mountain man / jungle native hybrid. I know it’s true. Why else would you play sports barefoot with such agility? It’s great.

I hope we get to serve together again; I’ve only scraped the surface of your wisdom and experience! You are a great missionary. Keep it up! See you around!

Sister Julie Ricks: “...you are a great missionary. You’re talented at singing, playing piano, learning languages, ping-pong, writing interesting books - the list goes on. But through it all, you do have humility. And not the annoying kind of fake humility where you try to tell everyone you’re no good (or else I probably would have thrown a book at you). You’re just a completely honest person, thank you.

Elder Hales: “I remember way back when, when I got to Ukraine. I think it was my second transfer and we were at zone sports. Everyone was talking aout how good this Elder Riley was at Russian and how good he was at soccer. I remember talking to you and you were just super happy and way excited about everything. I thought you were like way old in the mission and getting ready to go home but I found out by Elder Gelwix after zone sports that you were only like 2 transfers older than me! I thought man, I want to be like Elder Riley!

Elder Forrest Hangen: “Well, we only got to serve together for a few days, but man did we get some amazing work done! I mean this when I say it, you are my favorite companion so far!”

Sister Krystal Hassard: “First of all, I just have to say that you are outstanding, definitely one of the best missionaries that I know. You work so hard, and it shows.

Also your Russian is boss and I know that is due to the hard work you put into it every day. Thank you for giving me tips!

Thanks for being a great example, but more than that a friend.

...you just know how to get things done. You love work, and that says a ton! I guess you could sum a lot of it up and just say that you are focused. That is a trait that takes a lot of developing.”

Sister Alisa Winterton: “I’m super blessed that I was able to serve around you and especially when I first got into country. I learned so much from you, not only from your (usually) always wise words of wisdom but also your example of hard work and dedication. I really look up to and admire you so much and in many ways hope to becme more like you. You are one of the smartest and most organized and most driven people I have met in my many 22 years so that means something. … Thanks for your encouragement with Russian and always telling me to not sell myself short. Really I am quite glad we are friends and I think you are quite a lovely human being. … Oh and another thing, thanks for always being sincerely excited for me. You have no idea how much that always meant. You’re a saint.”

Elder Britton Rice: “I had a blast with you. … I’m gonna miss you. I’m really looking forward to BYU. I learned a lot from you. We worked really hard and I really enjoyed chastny tracting and eating fruit with you. Also our shoe shining parties. You’re a wonderful missionary and you’re really going places, …

...You’re a wonderful person. I really did enjoy my time with you!”

Advice

* Alicia Riley

“Let your excitement show. Make eye contact. People respond to sincerity.”

* Nick Riley

* President Robert Lochhead

Criticism

  * Notizen aus meiner Glaubenskrise

Habe ich mich verloren? Soll ich alles Frühere aufgeben?

Werde ich GV genießen können?

Werde ich die Lebesgeschichte der Sandra je verstehen?

Warum bin ich manchmal so neidisch?

Warum fühle ich mich unsicher?

Werde ich je in meinem Glauben so sicher sein, wie früher?

Mir ist schwer in der Mitte zwischen vielen Extremen. Was ist da zu tun?

Wie kann ich toleranter, verständnisvoller und mitfühlender werden?

Warum bin ich manchmal so undankbar für meine Erziehung und meinen Hintergrund?

Wozu ist meine Dringlichkeit nützlich und wann schädlich?

Wie kann ich mich selbst objektiver sehen?

Wie lerne ich mit der Nostalgie zu leben um gesund damit umzugehen?

Wie kann ich lernen, Deutschland ohne geistige Störung durch Auslöser zu lieben?

Wie wird das sein, das nächste Mal in Deutschland zu sein?

Wovor habe ich Angst?

Wie kann ich eine ausgewogene Beziehung zur Vergangenheit erreichen?

Warum hat mich das eben so sehr gestört, zu hören und zu denken, dass Sandra auch früher eine sexuelle Beziehung hatte?

  * Bitter Disappointment

If someone had told me at 12 that in a decade's time I would be lazy, undisciplined, and unworthy of respect, I would have refused to believe them on principle. I would have written out goals and a plan to avoid such an unattractive destiny.

The reality, though, is that with a few bright exceptions. I have become precisely what I most despise. Because I lack discipline, I cannot trust myself and I do not achieve my goals, and that makes life empty and unrewarding.

## General Guidelines

Manage energy and motivation levels, not just time. Everything is a finite resource, including attention.

Having as many things as possible covered by automatic habits is ideal.

Systems must be robust, which means that they are flexible and adaptable to unforeseen circumstances.

* [Pure 40 HZ Binaural Beats: The Frequency for FOCUS, MEMORY, and CONCENTRATION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_G60OdEzXs)

To everyone who's studying with this music:

Checklist:

• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

• Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy

Reminder:After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me.

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

( This comment isn't originally mine, but I think it can help a lot of people )

    “Le persone si dividono in due categorie, quelli che quando sta per cadere qualcosa di fragile e prezioso chiudono gli occhi, aspettando l'inevitabile rumore del frantumarsi; e quelli che si giocano il tutto per tutto, non si arrendono e cercano di salvare l'oggetto facendo da scudo contro il suolo. La vita è una questione di riflessi.”
